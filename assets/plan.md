Wordle Game Plan

Goal:
My goal is to remake a game like Wordle on the web. So, the user’s goal is to guess a random five-letter word and for each letter they get right, they will be told if it’s in the right position or the word; the user will be able to have 6 guesses for the word. I want it never to reload the page, so I plan to use JavaScript for everything. To be accessible for any user errors there will be friendly error messages, preventing numbers from being inputted, not allowing me to submit with less than 5 letters inputted, etc. I want the game to keep track of 2 scores on the screen, one being the current word guess streak the player is on, and the other is the max streak the player got.

Features:
No page reloading
6 Guesses at a word
Answered letters colored based on position
User-friendly messages
